What is this document?
---------------------

This document documents a pre-scripted set of tasks for Los Altos Hills emergency volunteer responders (CERT and ECC).
It describes the full activation process, which mostly is needed by folks in leadership positions.

We encourage everyone to become familiar with the whole process: it will make your individual steps make more sense,
and in an emergency you never know who may need to step into a leadership role.

But first timers should focus on the `Individuals`_ chapter, which describes what non-leadership folks need to do.
