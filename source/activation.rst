LAH Activation Procedure
========================

How to get up and running after an earthquake
---------------------------------------------

This article documents the activation procedure :term:`LAH` :term:`CERT`.
It focuses on the tasks we need to do at the beginning of an activation.

There are two activation scenarios we have:

- after an earthquake (activation by a rule in the town's Emergency Operation Plan [:term:`EOP`])
- anything else (only when notified by the town)

This document focuses on the earthquake scenario, and assumes the internet is either
not working or not universally available (for example: due to power being out).

History
-------

We (LAH CERT) used to have the rule of "check your zone, then go to the :term:`ARK`" after a significant earthquake.
It was decided to change that policy because the :term:`DSW` program requires everyone to
be tracked and under positive control.

The new policy is to either check in via ham radio or text, or if neither of those work to go to the ARK and check in there.

If the internet is out its very hard to handle those check-ins remotely, so we'll need a core staff at the
:term:`ARK` to handle the check-ins.

We did a tabletop dril of this check-in policy; it was hard to follow the original document.
This process is meant to simplify and streamline our check-in process while still not requiring everyone
to travel to the :term:`ARK` first.

Activation
----------

There are four situations where a town volunteer (ECC or CERT) might be activated:

#. When town or county personnel request it

#. After an earthquake strong enough to make 'things fall over or off shelves'

#. When there is an imminent threat of extreme peril or the need to mitigate a potential imminent threat to life, property or the environment, when time is of the essence and within the scope of your training.

#. When first responders (law, fire, public works, utility workers) directly request assistance for emergencies satisfying #3.

This document will only consider the first two, which are the two scenarios we train for.


Check-in from a ham radio operator's perspective
-----------------------------------------------

In general our ham operators can coordinate the easiest after being
activated: they don't need power or telecom infrastructure to be working.

There are two groups of ham operators in town: :term:`ECC`
operators and :term:`CERT` field operators (aka Recon).  The ECC's roles
are primarily to help staff the :term:`EOC` and other fixed locations in town.  
:term:`Recon` primarily serves as mobile teams around town.

In the case of an earthquake we have a pre-scripted set of tasks.

Roles in this document
-----------------------------------------------

The rest of this document describes several abstract roles in setting up a response.  Much like the
:term:`ICS` process multiple roles might be filled by a single person in a small response.  Also, roles
might be handed off from one person to another over time.

These position descriptions are only intended to outline the initial steps of the response, before the EOC and ARK are opened and fully operational.

* Net Control Operator (NCO)

  The NCO is in charge of running the radio net, collecting damage reports,
  and coordinating the selection of the initial Incident Commander.  This role is described in the `NCO`_ chapter.

.. _`NCO`: nco.html

* Incident Commander (IC)

  This should be a CERT Supervisor or ECC NCO
  who is familiar with the activation process.  The initial tasks of the IC are described in the
  `IC`_ chapter of this document.

.. _`IC`: ic.html

* County Liaison

  The County Liaison monitors both the local LAH net and the County Resource net, passing relevant messages
  back and forth between the two nets.  This role is described in the `Liaison`_ chapter.

.. _`Liaison`: liaison.html

* SMS Monitor

  Most of our CERTs aren't ham licensed (although we encourage everyone to monitor the net).
  We plan to communicate with the rest of our CERTs via SMS.  This role is described in the
  `SMS Monitor`_ chapter.

* Individuals

  The procedures for everyone else is described in the `Individuals`_ chapter.
